But recent research has cast doubt on this. One theory suggests that these crosses were used in a burial ground belonging to Christ Church, Newgate Street in London. This cemetery was in use from the mid 1500s until 1815. Inmates of Newgate prison and the poor from almshouses of the parish were buried there. The crosses were used to commemorate a grave in the absence of any family contributions. Mortuary crosses could be made of a wide variety of materials, including wood, twigs, wax and cloth.\n\nHow did graveyards and cemeteries cope with the vast number of burials during epidemics such as the Black Death? Most often bodies were piled in mass burial pits deep underground. Found during the excavation of a London cemetery, these lead crosses were said to have lain with victims of the Black Death outbreak of 1348-53.\n\nWhat were they for? Do they represent faith at a time of fear and crisis? Or were they used simply as markers? Experts say that medieval burial crosses were believed to protect the bodily remains. These ones are pretty basic in design and production \u2013 undecorated, with irregular edges and a battered surface. Were they made in a hurry because of the rapid burial of plague victims?\n\nArchaeologists Barney Sloane and Bruce Watson offer another explanation. Reviewing the evidence, they observed that the crosses were not found in mass burial pits but in smaller shafts suggestive of an institutional system of burial. They concluded that the bodies were most likely prisoners from nearby Newgate Gaol who had died of \u2018gaol distemper\u2019, or typhus, in the 1700s. \n\nAnd the crosses? Since no other lead burial crosses of this date have been reported, and documentary evidence is not yet found, Sloane and Watson can only speculate. Made by unskilled hands, perhaps the prisoners produced them for dying inmates, or themselves?
