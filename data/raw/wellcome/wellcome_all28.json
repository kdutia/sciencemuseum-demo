Sanitary Inspectors employed to check and report on the state of hygiene in their neighbourhood are the most likely audience. It was an essential part of their training, in preparation for examinations held by the Sanitary Institute and other public health associations. \nWomen gained the sanitary officer\u2019s certificate as often as men. In the mid-1890s, Hilda Martindale attended lectures at the Sanitary Institute, passed the examination, and went on to study public health and hygiene at Bedford College, London. What were her career prospects? She worked as a factory inspector for more than thirty years, becoming Deputy Chief Inspector in 1925.\nIt\u2019s possible Hilda Martindale was taught using this or a similar cabinet, so what\u2019s inside? It has three layers of miniature water supply and sewerage fittings, sanitary appliances such as toilets and wash basins, and equipment relating to the ventilation of buildings. Best practice could be demonstrated, but the cabinet also contains items showing incorrect or defective fittings posing a hazard to health. \nSimilar exhibits were found in the Parkes Museum, founded in 1876 as a memorial to military hygiene reformer Edmund Alexander Parkes.

It aimed to educate and inform the general householder and building tradespeople, complementing the work of the Sanitary Institute (with which it merged in 1888) to raise standards of public health.", "option2": "Brought to Life project"}, "summary_title": "Model of hygienic sanitary appliance (hygiene model; sanitary appliances)", "title": [{"primary": true, "value": "Model of hygienic sanitary appliance"}]}, "relationships": {"people": {"data": [{"type": "people", "id": "cp55276"}]}, "parent": {"data": [{"type": "parent", "id": "co48543"}]}, "places": {"data": [{"type": "places", "id": "cd114"}]}, "terms": {"data": [{"type": "terms", "id": "ct265330"}, {"type": "terms", "id": "ct261816"}, {"type": "terms", "id": "ct261878"}, {"type": "terms", "id": "ct261888"}, {"type": "terms", "id": "ct262192"}, {"type": "terms", "id": "ct265298"}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co8631657/model-of-hygienic-sanitary-appliance-hygiene-model-sanitary-appliances"}}, {"type": "objects", "id": "co8102895", "attributes": {"admin": {"added": 1495045468000, "analytics": {"count": {"total": 7}}, "created": 1227527430000, "id": "object-8102895", "language": "eng", "modified": 1573567087000, "previous_status": "valid and published", "processed": 1584396339043, "source": "smgc", "stream": "smg-online", "uid": "co8102895", "uuid": "1c861c22-492d-3991-92e4-e6d945fc524d", "version": 35}, "categories": [{"museum": "SCM", "name": "Anatomy & Pathology", "value": "SCM - Anatomy & Pathology"}], "component": [{"measurements": {"dimensions": [{"dimension": "depth", "units": "in", "value": "11 3/4"}, {"dimension": "depth", "units": "mm", "value": "298"}, {"dimension": "height", "units": "in", "value": "9/16"}, {"dimension": "height", "units": "mm", "value": "15"}, {"dimension": "width", "units": "in", "value": "11 7/8"}, {"dimension": "width", "units": "mm", "value": "301"}, {"units": "kg", "value": "1.83"}, {"units": "lbs", "value": "4.03448"}], "display": "overall (with base): 15 mm x 301 mm x 298 mm, 1.83 kg"}, "name": "overall (with base)"}, {"measurements": {"dimensions": [{"dimension": "depth", "units": "in", "value": "8 1/4"}, {"dimension": "depth", "units": "mm", "value": "210"}, {"dimension": "height", "units": "in", "value": "2 15/16"}, {"dimension": "height", "units": "mm", "value": "75"}, {"dimension": "width", "units": "in", "value": "3 1/8"}, {"dimension": "width", "units": "mm", "value": "80"}, {"units": "kg", "value": "0.13"}, {"units": "lbs", "value": "0.2866"}], "display": "overall (right): 75 mm x 80 mm x 210 mm, 0.13 kg"}, "name": "overall (right)"}, {"measurements": {"dimensions": [{"dimension": "depth", "units": "in", "value": "9 1/16"}, {"dimension": "depth", "units": "mm", "value": "230"}, {"dimension": "height", "units": "in", "value": "3 1/16"}, {"dimension": "height", "units": "mm", "value": "77"}, {"dimension": "width", "units": "in", "value": "3 1/8"}, {"dimension": "width", "units": "mm", "value": "80"}, {"units": "kg", "value": "0.14"}, {"units": "lbs", "value": "0.30865"}], "display": "overall (left): 77 mm x 80 mm x 230 mm, 0.14 kg"}, "name": "overall (left)"}], "dates": {"DATE1": "2010-03-31"}, "description": [{"primary": true, "type": "description", "value": "Left and right  foot showing effects of leprosy, from a skeleton from a medieval Danish leprosy cemetery, reputedly c.1350"}, {"type": "web description", "value": "The right and left feet show the devastating effects of leprosy on the bones of the body.
