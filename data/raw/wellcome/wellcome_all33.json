Researcher Annie Thwaite advised: \n\nThe derivation of the word \u2018Billiken\u2019 is from a \u2018charm doll\u2019 created by American art teacher and illustrator Florence Pretz of Kansas City, Missouri, who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream, and patented the design in 1908. The Billiken is known as \u2018The God of Things As They Ought to Be\u2019, and whilst the purchase of a Billiken was said to give the customer luck, being given one would afford even greater luck. The Billiken has been adopted as a \u2018mascot\u2019 by several institutions, including Saint Louis University, Missouri.  Most notably in the case of this object however is the selection of the Billiken by a chain of amusement parks named \u2018Luna Park\u2019. Parks both defunct and currently operational span every continent but Antarctica, the first of which opened in New York in 1903. According to the text on the reverse (see Image 7, p. 22) this token is from a Luna Park in Paris, as indicated by words on back indicating its origin \u2013 \u2018Porte-Maillot\u2019, an area of Paris. The inscription on the front reads: \u2018Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I smile at you bad luck can\u2019t harm you.\u2019 We can therefore conclude that the dates given to this object are inaccurate \u2013 if the Billiken was only patented in 1908, this token cannot be from as early as 1891; and similarly, the Paris branch of Luna Park only opened around c.1907-9 (closing in 1931). The dates for this object therefore seem more likely to be 1909-1931.
